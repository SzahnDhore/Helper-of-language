This also includes installing and setting up the system. There are only five simple steps from downloading the system to having it up and running:\r\n\r\n1. Copy the files to your server.\r\n2. Edit the settings.\r\n3. Add phrasebooks.\r\n4. Include the file \"class.language.php\".\r\n5. Initiate a new instance of the class \"language\".\r\n6. Call a phrase using the function \"phrase\".\r\n\r\nThere you go, all set!\r\n\r\n\r\nA longer explanation of the above\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you find the list above to be too brief for your liking (or you simply enjoy reading this document) you can find a more detailed guide below.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Copy the files to your server\r\nUpload the folder (along with with all its content) to the root of your project. You should now have a folder in your root called *lang* having all important content inside of it.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Edit the settings\r\nOpen the file named \"settings.php\" and edit the settings if needed. You should normally only need to modify the setting for `default`, and maybe `nophrase`. The other settings shouldn't really need to be modified, but if you have to change them they're there.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Add phrasebooks\r\nCreate a phrasebook file having the name \"xxx.php\" (where \"xxx\" is the ISO 639-3 language code of the default language of the project) and put it in your library folder. For a reference of how the contents of the file should be formated, please see the included example files.\r\n\r\nTo subsequently add a language to your system, all you have to do is to upload a new, correctly written and formatted, language file to the phrasebook folder. This makes it very simple for you to add more languages.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Include the file \"class.language.php\"\r\nYou will need two lines of extra code in your project to set up the system for use. The first is to include the script in the file you want to use it in. It should look something akin to this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\ninclude_once 'lang/class.language.php';\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaturally, you have to make sure that the path to \"class.language.php\" reflects the actual setup on your server.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Initiate a new instance of the class \"language\"\r\nThe second line of code you need to add initiates the magic itself. Just add the following:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$lang = new language();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaturally, you can name the object whatever you want. I like `$lang` personally, but you could, for instance, use `$l` if you like something shorter.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Call a phrase using the function \"phrase\"\r\nNow that the system is set up we can start using it. Assuming everything is in order, the following command will return the specified string:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$lang->phrase('string')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will look for a corresponding entry in the appropriate phrasebook and return it. In this particualar case, it looks for the keyword \"string\" and returns whatever value is assigned to that keyword.\r\n\r\nYou should now be up and running. Congratulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctions and stuff\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe following descriptions and examples assumes a variable name of `$lang` for the class and that all settings are at their default.\r\n\r\n### `$lang->phrase('foo')`\r\nReturns the phrase corresponding to the keyword \"foo\".\r\n\r\n### `$lang->langlist()`\r\nReturns a list of currently installed languages. The list is an unordered list in HTML without line breaks or indentation.\r\n\r\nYou can add images to the image directory and have the system fetch them as well. Each image should be in PNG-format and have the same filename as the ISO639-3 code of the corresponding language. So if you, for example, want a swedish flag to be displayed in the list, you add a PNG-file named \"swe.png\" to the directory named \"images\" and call the function using the argument `true`, like so: `$lang->langlist(true)`\r\n\r\nYou cannot return a list without the text. If you only want to display the images you should instead hide the text using CSS.\r\n\r\n### `$lang->langcode()`\r\nReturns the ISO639 language code for the currently used language.\r\n\r\nBy default, the ISO639-1 code is returned. This is because HTML normally uses that code and is therefore the version you will most often need. You can specify that you want the ISO639-3 code instead of ISO639-1 by setting the argument to `3`. Like so: `$lang->langlist(3)`\r\n\r\n\r\nTo do\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* Add option to turn off fallback language. Makes it easier to spot untranslated phrases.\r\n* Add other way than $_GET to set the language. Will look into using the session variable and cookies.\r\n* Look into how to best return more information about a language, such as text direction.\r\n* Possibility to apply stuff to returned strings. Both globally and individually.\r\n* Add method of supporting varibles in string.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown bugs and limitations\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n### Phrasebook uploading\r\nAfter uploading multiple phrasebooks you may find that the system doesn't find them all. The solution is to upload them one by one and refresh the library between each upload. I'm not sure why this is happening, but I'm looking into it.\r\n\r\n### Dropped `<` in list\r\nI've observed a dropped `<` character in the language list. It only seems to happen after I've uploaded a phrasebook and after refreshing a couple of times the character is back again. Not a priority at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments and credits\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n### People\r\n\r\n##### My girlfriend\r\nShe hasn't contributed to or tested the code and she isn't very interested in hearing me talk about it, but at least she almost pretends to listen to me when I do. That's all I can ask for, I suppose.\r\n\r\n### External resources\r\n* This project includes images from the Flag Icon set by Mark James.
